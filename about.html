            <h3>Who We Are &amp; Company History</h3>
            <p>Unfiltered is an independent and user-collaborative video game software developer co-founded by a group of twenty-something baristas who have a passion for games that excel in storytelling and design. Unfiltered aims to change the face of the indie game industry by demonstrating that brilliant work can be effectively created and distributed with minimal resources. Unfiltered projects take collaboration to a whole new level by involving their online community in the creation process.</p>
            <p>Unfiltered was founded in 2021 by a small group of Starbucks baristas who share a passion for using art dynamically to tell interactive and engaging stories. Unable to hold back their intrinsic desires to create, Rachel Epps and Zach Thomsen began forming the concept of a video game about an alien who is framed for committing crimes against the universe. This concept grew into an epic odyssey across the universe, jam-packed with themed worlds, each inhabited by uniquely captivating alien villains. Sebastian Calderon, another barista, soon became a key member of the team, contributing as a storyteller and character developer.</p>
            <p>As the baristas continued their work on Escape from Space Prison, they realized the notion that one cannot create video games without immense capital is a myth. Realizing the power that can be harnessed with the internet, the three baristas founded Unfiltered with the intent to design, develop, and implement multi-platform video games for both entertainment and education. Now they are offering anyone with an interest in creating art, telling stories, or developing games the opportunity to become a part of the game design process as a member of the Unfiltered community.</p>
            <h3 id="brand">A Refreshing Blend: Indie Studio + Collaboration Network</h3>
            <p>While other indie game developers work in a fully internal design/development process, our workflow involves the community in a highly collaborative and engaging way. While some collaboration websites for indie games do exist, none of them are operating actual game studios. Our online platform is like a creative enhancement juice that runs through our studio’s veins, fusing the concept of virtual collaboration and indie game studios in a way that has never been seen before. The difference is that we have more direction than just a social platform; the studio ultimately develops the bulk of the designs and initiates project concepts into action.</p>
            <p>Our company defies corporate culture without sacrificing credibility or relevance by using organic methods to promote our products, creating quality products out of minimal resources, and involving our community in the game development process. Not only are we a small team, but we are also committed to never selling out so that we will never lose creative control. This means that YOU will always get a say in the games we produce.</p>
